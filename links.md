[**Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces; OSTEP**](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)<br>A free online form of the book split by chapters. The site also updates with litle changes sometimes and also provides other links to more study tools.
<p>[**Operating Systems - geeksforgeeks**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-systems/)<br>A page that links to every OS-adjacent page on geeksforgeeks. They're written in order, so if you don't have any knowledge, you can check previous pages for more information.</p>
